this project has been a learning experience 
and to qoute the iconic developer
"At the time of deploy, Only God and I know how this code works, after a month it will be only God," so proceed with caution !
but on a more serious note this project has taught me that I have a lot more to learn, and a lot more practicing to do.
But this is my submission for my capstone project!
